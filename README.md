# 1st project for the Nanodegree - Chopstick Length

It has been a long journey since I have decided to install Anaconda in Google Cloud. After this process doing the change with Markdowns and running the code was quite fast and easy.

# Lessons Learnt

* After taking the 1st lesson of Statistics, I can said this is getting more insteresting than before
* Running this in your computer could be easy but I have been learning Google Cloud as well so this was a good opportunity for apply my learning and practice
* Pushing the changes against github is one of the keys because in case you lose the instance or your computer was pee by your dog your work is still safe
* It's important to take notes during the lesson and the process so that the work doing the project is less and you can always go back to the notes

Thanks and welcome the feedback.
